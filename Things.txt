2(x+3)=5x-2. 2(x+3)+5=5x-3. Have print statements stored as strings then just random passed in. (Choose one from : Good job, excellent work ...)

Need to start keeping track of whether the user got the answer correct or not.
	We will return a number saying whether the user's answer was:
		1. correct (full credit)
		2. common mistake (get some partial credit)
		3. wrong (no credit)
	In global function we will keep track of how many of each problem set the user has gotten correct
	and how many question of each problem set have been asked.
	Eventually we want to calculate a score based on how the user is doing

Make it so on distributive problems we do not have a front coefficient of 1

Last problem set should have fractional coefficients and also possibility of whole number fractions

Make it so if user inputs non int then it doesn't ruin the rest of the run.
