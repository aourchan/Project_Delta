Need to start keeping track of whether the user got the answer correct or not.
	We will return a number saying whether the user's answer was:
		1. correct (full credit)
		2. common mistake (get some partial credit)
		3. wrong (no credit)
	In global function we will keep track of how many of each problem set the user has gotten correct
	and how many question of each problem set have been asked.
	Eventually we want to calculate a score based on how the user is doing

Create problem set with fractional coefficients and possibility of fraction user answers

Create function that keeps track of user score and score on each problem set

Create function that prints out user scores and quits out of program nicely.
